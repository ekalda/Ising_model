# Ising model

A simple simulation of a 2D Ising model for specified temperature an initial conditions. 

Choice of:
- two different dynamics (Glauber or Kawasaki) 
- system parameters to evaluate (total energy, total magnetisation, heat capacity, susceptibility)
- two different formalisms for finding the error on heat capacity and susceptibility (bootstrap or jacknife)
